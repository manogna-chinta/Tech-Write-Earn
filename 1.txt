Types of documents technical writers create

Some typical documents that technical writers create include:

User manuals: These are documents that provide instructions on how to use a product or service, often including a list of features and step-by-step instructions. For example, a User Guide for a piece of software could include instructions on how to install the software, how to use the features of the software, and how to troubleshoot common problems.


Release notes: These documents provide information about new features, bug fixes, and other updates to a software product or system. They are usually intended for users who are already familiar with the product or system. For example, release notes for a software development framework such as React might include information about new features that have been added, bugs that have been fixed, and known issues that still need to be addressed.


Online help: These are documents that provide users with context-sensitive information as they use a software product or system. They are typically accessed through the software product or system. For instance, when using a software development environment such as Visual Studio, the online help document helps you learn how to use specific features such as debugging tools or how to set up a development environment.


Technical specifications: These documents detail the technical features and capabilities of a software product or system. For example, a Technical Specification for a piece of software details the software's architecture, the programming languages and libraries used, and the hardware requirements.


White Papers: These are documents that provide a detailed analysis of a product or service. For example, a White Paper for a piece of software could provide an in-depth analysis of the features and benefits of the software, as well as comparisons to other similar software products.


Technical proposal and briefs: As a technical writer, you require a technical proposal or brief for every technical document you plan to write. These documents serve as a roadmap for creating other technical documents, by outlining the document's goal, scope, intended audience, and writing style.


Technical reports: These are written to document research findings, test results, and other technical information. For example, a technical report on the results of a usability testing for a mobile app would include information on user feedback, areas of the app that confuse users, and their suggestions for improvement.



Knowledge base articles: These are documents that provide step-by-step instructions on how to use a feature, product, or system. For example, a Knowledge Base Article for a piece of software could provide information about the software, such as how to install it, how to use it, and how to troubleshoot common problems.
